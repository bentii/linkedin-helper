# linkedin-helper

Just a lil script to help get a job
Easy to use

0 - Create a file .env and write LINKEDIN_USERNAME = your email no " needed
                                LINKEDIN_PASSWORD = your password no " needed

1 - Setup selenium
  It's already setup for chrome in linux, but you can easily setup
  following here: https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/installation.html

2 - You can active cookies, headless mode and capatcha autoclose by uncommenting in the script.py

3 - Run: python script.py who you wish to find(string) Number(int) of pages the program will seek
          eq: python3 script.py "It Recruiter" 4

4 - I don't recommend run multiple times because capatch breaks the script

Last of all use at your own risk
